# The first stage of the Thanh Phuoc Port

The first stage of the Thanh Phuoc Port in the southern province of Binh Duong , opened on May 9, making it possible to transport container cargo to Ho Chi Minh City by boat, reported Thai News Service.

Located on the Dong Nai River in Tan Uyen district’s Thanh Phuoc commune, the new port has 37,000 sq m of warehouses and two piers which can handle 312,500 tonnes of goods per year.

The first stage, to be completed in 2014, will cost US\$37.5 million and have eight piers that can handle 2.5 million tonnes of cargo.

The second stage, to be completed in 2018, will have 16 piers that can accommodate vessels of up to 2,000 tonnes and handle five million tonnes, a wastewater treatment system, and other support facilities. It is expected to cost \$70 million.

The port would enhance the capacity of HCM City ‘s deep-water ports and curb congestion on roads entering the city, Thanh Phuoc Port Corporation, its developer, said.

Currently, all goods transported between Binh Duong and HCM City’s ports had to be taken by road.
